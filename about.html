            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>The story behind Tori's Tacos begins when the founder, Tori,
                woke up one morning having slept extremely poorly the night before.
                They rotted away on their phone for hours, scrolling through Instagram Reels,
                and seeing beautiful tacos. Tori had a sudden craving for tacos, and decided to
                go out and get tacos when they'd come home from school and took their quiz.
                However, they bombed the quiz, and were extremely sad. They decided to go to their favorite taco
                place to cheer themselves up, but when they got there, they found out it was closed.
                Tori was devastated, and decided to make their own tacos at home. They made some
                delicious tacos, and decided to share them with their wife. Their wife loved them, and
                encouraged Tori to have their friends try the tacos, and their friends loved the tacos.
                After that, their friends encouraged Tori to open a taco restaurant. And thus, Tori's Tacos was born!
